In this report, I will present the results of some analysis done to the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset contains information on housing in Boston around 1978. The dataset has 506 cases. The target variable is housing prices, and the features include per capita crime rate, average number of rooms, pupil/teacher ratio town, and proximity to employment centres.
The first graph shows that the distribution of the target variable home values. This is a normal, Bell-curve distribution, which can help inform us in probability calculations.
In the second graph, I looked at the relationship between the normal of rooms in a dwelling and the home values, with the expectation that the higher the number of rooms, the higher the home value. The graph confirms this assumption. Outliers are shown in a different color.
Next, I observe the relationship between the Pupil/Teacher Ratio and Home Values. The expectation is that the higher the number of students per teacher, the lower the home values. The graph confirms this assumption, though the fit isnâ€™t as perfect as in the prior graph. Here, outliers are shown with a different shape (triangles).
Finally, I observe the effect of the proximity to employment centres on the age of the homes, so that I could determine if the newer homes are closer to employment centres. The result is downward sloping for the most part, with a slight upward tick for the most distant homes. This implies that for the most part, the older owner-occupied homes are located closer to the employment centres, with newer developments or rentals being further away. Outliers here are indicated by larger circles.
